            <span className="p-1">I am currently a Brooklyn College student majoring in Computer Science.</span>
            <span className="p-1">My graduation date is expected to be in the Spring of 2026.</span> 
            I have taken up this major because, 
            as a child, I was always fascinated by the mystery behind programmers and their code â€” how talented people had to be 
            to create the games I played growing up, as well as the creative, modern, and sophisticated websites and apps I've seen.
            I have always wondered how people did what they did. Now, I am learning to become one of those people.
